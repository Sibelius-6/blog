This post is a combination of two old posts.

## Lecture notes
Since cross references in lecture notes are important, I created a template for theorem/lemma/proposition... blocks with beamer skin and proof/remark... blocks and equation block. You can see the result via [here](/pdfs/template.pdf) and the LaTeX code via [here](https://github.com/Sibelius-6/class-note-template).

Update: latest LaTeX notes template are integrated with more features and options. Available upon request: [Contact me](https://notes.sibeliusp.com/contact)

## Class Schedules
Here is an example that how LaTeX can be used to make university class schedules.
