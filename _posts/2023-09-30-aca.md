Recently, I found a great source of learning acapella recording, editing and mixing. The website is called [recordingacapella.com](https://recordingacappella.com/){:target="_blank"}. Here is some random notes I made during learning this material.

Keep it in the green. Loudest barely touch yellow/orange. This gives a usable track.

# Editing Vocal Percussion

Not useful for me now as I can't beatbox...

# The Bass Octave Track…

This is useful. As David Tao is using this technique in his [tuberose](https://youtu.be/hIcxb_sqBnU).

- Duplicate the track.
- autotune 7: transpose -12 steps, troat length 63, bypass all notes. Select all highlighted audio and render.
- can use melodyne also, might need to lower formant.
- for dup track, eliminate higher frequencies. Channel strip: high pass filter, low pass filter (~100), don't need below 40. gained up. Compressor 5:1.
- some distortion. Decapitator (Nasty, Grainy Saturation), little extra edge.
- not stereo, no reverb

# Aca mixing - basic eq
- bass track: bump in lower end, higher end is minimized
- baritone: distort in high end, cut out in the middle, below 100 is rolled off
- tenor: roughly same as baritone
- alto/soprano: roll off below 300, carve out space for men

# Compression
[Why do we use compression on an acappella track?](https://youtu.be/skcbeGLmwO4?si=youtube-sucks)

- to control volume, dynamics processor. Gain is reduced and made up. More consistency throughout the track.
- for drum track. soft sounds louder, more spit, more energy, more noise, more attacks, more crisp.
- for bass, much beefier, fatter, bring out sustain.
- automated volume fader.
- start with compressor presets.

# Panning

- lead vocal, drum, bass: center. 
- other hard panned.
