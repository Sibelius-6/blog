This is a mix of music and physics study plans.

## Music
Here is what they called traditional 4 parts of composition (传统四大件):

- 和声 Harmony
- 配器 Orchestration
- 曲式 Musical form
- 复调 Polyphony

## Physics
Here is my plan of learning physics, especially mechanics:

**The hardest four mechanics**:
- 《理论力学》: Analytical (Theoretical) mechanics
- 《电动力学》: Classical electromagnetism
- 《量子力学》: Quantum mechanics
- 《热力学与统计物理》: Statistical mechanics
